# openglgame

This is our project for our graphics class.  The project is intended to be a game but as 
of right now, we are still unsure of what type of game that it will be. This version of the project 
currently doesn't do much.  It's just a a square that you can move and another square that is static.
I'm going to try to add collision detection tomorrow.  The aim is to do a 2D game with 3D textures.
We are using vertex and fragment shaders to load the graphics in the GPU.

Two different color blocks.  One moves and the other remains static.
